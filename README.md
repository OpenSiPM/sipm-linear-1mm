# overview
This repository contains a 16 channel linear array detector designed for hyperspectral fluorescense imaging. Each channel is composed of a single 1x1 mm Hamamatsu S14160 SiPM mounted in a carrier board. These feed into 16 pole zero filters and 16 transimpedance amplifiers adapted from the OpenSiPM single channel design.

# pcb
The PCB is a 4 layer board that can be manufactured inexpensive (few dollars plus shipping) from a number of prototyping services. It could additionally be assembled with at least the passive components on relatively inexpensive, or it can be hand soldered via reflow. Aside from the Hamamatsdu SiPM, the components are stock at Digikey/Mouser.
